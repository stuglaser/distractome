# Distractome

A Google Chrome extension that guilt trips you for being distracted.

Set your list of websites that are distractions, and Distractome will
track how long you've been distracted and how short you've been
productive.

Distractome uses experimental chrome features ([infobars](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/experimental.infobars.html)), so chrome must be run with the following flag:

    google-chrome --enable-experimental-extension-apis
